1 - What were you doing before bootcamp?
Before bootcamp I was teaching music technology and private composition lessons at NKU.
I also worked as an orchestrator for the music production team of a Malaysian horror film, and am currently finishing up the score to a short.
A year ago, I finished my master's at a school in Dublin, Ireland. It was a brilliant year.

2 - Why MAX?
I have joined the program at MAX through the Apprenti program. 

3 - What will you do after MAX?
Hopefully by then Apprenti will have secured a hiring partner and I'll have a job lined up.
Regardless, I'll be securing some type of employment that utilizes the skills learned through this program.
My goal is a solid career. Fortunately, these skills are in high-demand at present, and they're thoroughly enjoyable.
